## Roles
- Ryan Jacobo - Frontend Lead java junior developer
- Rayshaun Thompson - Backend Lead java junior developer
- Jeremiah Bolden - Backend java junior developer
- Payton Davis - Frontend java junior developer


## Overview / User Story
- Users will be presented with algebra expressions of various difficulties.
- A timer will decrease until they enter the answer in the text below, at which they’ll be presented with a new problem
- Each user will start with # hit points, while incorrect answers will reduce the their hit points, correct answers will increase the timer
- Streaks of correct answers will give a bigger bonus
- The ends when the timer hits zero


## MVP
- Users can create account with input validation
- Find API for creating and displaying math text, similar to LatEx
- Users should be able to report a question if they believe it is wrong
- Users and stat data stored in AWS DB
- Deploy app on AWS EC2
- Skipping a question will reduce the timer
- Math problem is displayed with a text field below it
- Math problems are presented beautifully with superscripts and math symbols

	
## Stretch Goals
- Users leaderboard
- Buttons for menu navigation
- Implement hints
- Give users more difficult problems as they get better
- Users have profiles they can customize and see other users at a glance: skills/stats in other math categories

- [find captcha API to avoid bots]
- Users can try to match with other (dating app swiping/page format) and users after seeing their bio/stats
- Any users that are online and match to each other create instance of math battle
- If two users match with each other, they will begin a math battle a la tetris battle 
- Post battle stat update for public view in matching
- Choose which category of math to seek matches
- Admins can create problems
- Different battle types:
- correct answers reduce timer available for opponent (if given different questions)
- Actually tetris, correct answers put a block on the other players side
- Allow matches to occur when users are offline, schedule math battle for later
- Users with highest rank in a math category get a special title… or something
- Users can create math problems for other users to do and rate
- Number of Solutions by a user should be displayed on a users profile
- Users take questionnaire of math problems to see what they good at
- Users can wager points before battle starts but opponent must agree to wager
